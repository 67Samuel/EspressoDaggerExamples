# Advanced UI testing with Espresso

1. Dagger2 (**no dagger-android since it will be deprecated**)
     - Mocking components and modules
     - Subcomponents with Factory implementation
          - One activity per subcomponent
     - Map multibindings
2. LiveData and ViewModels
3. MVVM / MVI architecture
4. Navigation Components
5. Multi-activity (not single-activity)

**Work in progress**
